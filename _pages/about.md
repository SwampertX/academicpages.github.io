I am an incoming Master's student at the *École Polytechnique*. I am interested
in logic, verified proofs, and the Coq proof assistant.

Previously, I did my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Computer Science at the
[National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/). My
[thesis](https://github.com/SwampertX/undergraduate-thesis) was on the
formalization of Coq Modules in the [MetaCoq](https://metacoq.github.io/)
project, co-supervised by Nicolas Tabareau, Martin Henz, and Yue Yang. I was
also part of the [University Scholars Programme](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/).

# News
- In September 2023, I will start my Masters in the Parisian Master
  of Research in Computer Science (MPRI), at the *École Polytechnique*.
- I have graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) after a
  five-year, double-degree Bachelor's program in Mathematics and Computer
  Science.
