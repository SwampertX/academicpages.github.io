I am a first-year masters student studying the [Parisian Master of Research in
Computer Science (MPRI)][mpri] at [*École Polytechnique*][x]. My research
interests lie in logic, verified proofs, and proof assistants (such as
[Coq][coq]).

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's Degrees in Mathematics and Computer Science
at the [National University of Singapore][nus]. I wrote my [thesis](#thesis) on
the formalization of Coq Modules in the [MetaCoq](https://metacoq.github.io/)
project, co-supervised by Nicolas Tabareau, Martin Henz, and Yue Yang. I was
also part of the [University Scholars Programme](https://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/),
the honors college of [NUS][nus].
